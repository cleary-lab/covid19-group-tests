# Group testing for efficient screening of SARS-CoV-2
This code accompanies our manuscript *Using viral load and epidemic dynamics to optimize pooled testing in resource constrained settings*.

## Getting Started
------------
There are two parts to this project:
  A. Fitting and simulation of viral load trajectories
  B. Assessing pooling designs for individual identification and prevalence estimation using simulated viral loads
  
The first part of this project takes place entirely in R. We used R version 4.0.2. The second part takes place entirely in Python. For part A, please see [this section](code/viral_kinetics/README.md). For part B, please see [this section](code/group_test_simulations/README.md) to get started.
